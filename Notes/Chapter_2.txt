Chapter 2: Lexical Structure 
============================ 

The lexical structure of a programming language is a set of 
elmentary rules that specifies how you write programs in that language. 
It is the lowerst-level syntax of a language: it specifies what variable 
names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, 
and how one program statement is separated from the enxt, fro example. 
This shoer chapter documents the lexical structure of JavaSCript. 

# Topics Covered 
1. Case sensitivity, spaces, and line breaks 
2. Comments 
3. Literals 
4. Identifiers and reserved words 
5. Unicode 
7. Optional semicolons 

# The Text of a JavaScript Program 
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, 
function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent 
capitalization of letters. The while keyword, for example, must be typed 
"while" and not "While" or "WHILE." Similarly, online, Online, OnLine, and 
ONLINE are four distinct variable names. 

JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens(?) in programs. 
For the most part, JS also ignores line breaks, but there are some exceptions. 
Because you can use spaces newlines freely in your programs, you can format 
and indent your programs in aneat and consistent way that makes the code easy 
to read and understand. 

## Ignored by JS 
1. Regular Space Character (\u0020) 
2. Tabs 
3. Assorted ASCII control characters 
4. Various Unicode space characters as white space. 
5. Newlines 
6. Carriage return/line feed sequence as line terminators. 

Some of these may seem strange at this point, but we will understand these in 
due time. There are exceptions to these ignoring rules too. And those must be 
managed carefully. 

## Comments
JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Anny text between a // and a new line 
is treated as a single-line comment and is ignored by JS. 

Any text between /* and */ is also ignored, even as multi-line comment. 

You may put as many comments in your code as your like. Sometimes I like to 
put quotes from famous people in my comments.
